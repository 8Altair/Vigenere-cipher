# Vigenere-cipher

This project can cipher any text using Vigenere (Blaise de Vigenere) cipher, or decipher it.
It uses method called "index of coincidence", based on the given probabilities. The code works
in 99% cases, which means it works when it it is possible to cipher/decipher string.
There is also an option to import txt file instead of writing the message, and to export the
message in txt file instead of losing it forever.

Note: Names of folders and even code variables are often written in Bosnian. Also, it only works for
Bosnian/Croatian, but it can be easily modified to work on any given language.
